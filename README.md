# Unfinished Project

### Currently looking for collaborators

- This project is meant to be a simple e-commerce where users can post view and post sales
- Each sale is meant to have a title, description and an image
- Each is image is to be stored on aws s3 in my personal account with free tier
- Technologies used are spring for the backend and thymeleaf + bootstrap for frontend, and I'd like to keep it that way,
  but I'm finding that this might not be the best choice actually
